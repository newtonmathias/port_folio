            Hey there! I&apos;m Newton, a passionate software engineer
            specializing in full-stack development and offensive security, based
            in Nairobi. My journey into engineering began during my BSc in
            Electronic and Computer Engineering. Over the years, my interest in
            creating things on the internet has evolved, and I&apos;ve honed my

            With a solid foundation in cybersecurity, honed through hands-on
            experiences in bug bounty programs like HackerOne, I seamlessly
            integrate security into my web development expertise. Possessing a
            knack for uncovering vulnerabilities, I prioritize fortifying my
            work against potential threats.
